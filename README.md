# Sudoku Solver
Sudoku Solver is a Java program with a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) implemented using JavaFX. This program efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels, providing users with a satisfying solving experience.

## Features
* Interactive GUI: Sudoku Solver offers an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to interact with the program seamlessly, inputting puzzle values and receiving solutions effortlessly.

* Zoom: The program provides a slider to adjust zoom, allowing users to select a comfortable viewing size.

* Input methods: There are two different ways of inputting a puzzle, either via the provided grid, which supports arrow key traversal, or via a text area, which facilitates copying and pasting puzzles conveniently.

* Solving Strategies: Three different solving strategies are available for the user to pick between (breadth-first search, depth-first search and best-first search). The time taken to solve a puzzle is displayed afterwards, allowing the user to compare the performance of the different strategies for different puzzles.

* Error Detection: The program incorporates error detection functionality to prevent crashes and inform the user of any errors in their input.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have JDK and JavaFX installed on your system. [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17) and [JavaFX 21.0.1](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/) were used for this project.

Clone the Sudoku-Solver repository to your local machine.

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

Run the SudokuGUI class to launch the Sudoku Solver application. SudokuGUI is just used to launch the JavaFX application and serves no other purpose.
